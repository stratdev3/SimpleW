# Frequently Asked Questions

> Is this a toy or production-ready ?

I've been working in web application development for the past 20 years. SimpleW is the result of experiments, successes, failures, and lessons learned. It covers my own needs, and I've been using it in all my SaaS products for the last 5 years.
All core components are production-ready.

> Why open-source this tool ?

Because I strongly believe in open source, and I use open-source software every day. It's simply a matter of principle.

> How to contribute ?

Github is just a mirror. Open an issue or a PR, ping me, if your code is interesting and still MIT license, I will pull from your repo.

> Why do you hate ASP.NET Core ?

I don't hate it, but I don't like it (see the paragraph about [Why this library exists](../guide/what-is-simplew.md#why-this-library)).

> What is the primary goal of SimpleW ?

It's in the name : **simplicity first** ! <br />
I embrace the [KISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) principle, whether on the API side or on the developer side.
In other words, not only should users have a simple way to use SimpleW, but its source code should also be easy to read.

> "Blazingly Fast" slogan ?

I admit that nowadays almost every open-source project overuses the word blazing in its description.
But when it is actually true (see [performance comparisons](../guide/performances.md) or [TechEmpower](https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks) results), then it deserves to be used.

> Support .NET Framework

I don't want to support .NET Framework.
Just update your dying runtime !

> Addons ?

I want to keep the core simple and lightweight so that :
- The code can be reviewed by a developer in a few hours
- Or fully ingested (and reasoned about) by an AI in a few seconds

Addons are the place for everything that does not belong in the core.
Also, a product is much easier to adopt when there is a healthy ecosystem around it.

> How to use SimpleW ?

I spent a **crazy** amount of time writing documentation. Please, [RTFM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTFM)

> I still have understanding issue ?

If you still have issue, [ping me on Discord](https://discord.gg/mDNRjyV8Ak) and I'll try to look at it.
