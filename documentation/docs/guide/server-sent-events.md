# Server Sent Events

Server-Sent Events (SSE) is a server push technology enabling a client to receive automatic updates from a server via an HTTP connection.

## Pushing data to all clients

This example illustrates how SimpleW can be used to :
1. serve an index.html static file which contains javascript code to connect to server sent events
2. serve a sse endpoint with `server.AddDynamicContent()`
3. response to all clients

Open your browser to `http://localhost:2015/` :
- your browser will connect to SSE endpoint and show logs connections
- press the `connect` button in the html page
- press `s` key from the server console to send a SSE message to all clients.
- see logs in both side.

Note : the `server.BroadcastSSESessions()` will send response to all SSE clients.


## Pushing data to specifics clients

In the following example, the SSE is only enabled for authenticated user.
Then the broadcast will target only administrator profils.
