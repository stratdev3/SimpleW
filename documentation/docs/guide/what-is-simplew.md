# What is SimpleW?

SimpleW is a .NET Core library designed for building fast and secure web applications.

## Architecture

SimpleW‚Äôs architecture and motivations behind its core design choices :

- **Pure C# (100% managed code)**, running on .NET‚ÄØ8 or later.
- **Built on top of native sockets**, no HttpListener inside.
- **Compiled delegate**, close to hard-coded method calls.
- **Event model**, low latency and low memory.
- **Cross‚Äëplatform support**, Windows/Linux/Android/macOS.
- **NuGet package available**, easy to integrate

It is based in the great [NetCoreServer](https://github.com/chronoxor/NetCoreServer) socket server.


## Use Cases

- **High‚ÄëPerformance**

When network efficiency and observability are critical, **SimpleW ensures fast request throughput and low latency**.
Coupled with automatic OpenTelemetry instrumentation, you gain full visibility into request flows, latency, and error rates‚Äîenabling you to scale horizontally with confidence.

- **Rapid API Prototype**

When you need to **deliver a proof‚Äëof‚Äëconcept API in record time**, SimpleW excels. Its minimal configuration lets you define endpoints in just a few lines of code. With JSON serialization handled automatically and no heavyweight server plumbing to configure, developers can focus on business logic from the very first compile.

- **Embedded Service**

When resources are constrained, SimpleW‚Äôs **tiny memory footprint and makes it ideal for lightweight background services**, command‚Äëand‚Äëcontrol agents, or any situation where simplicity and reliability are paramount.

- **static site**

Need to ship a single‚Äëpage app or docs alongside your API? With SimpleW you point to a folder (e.g. wwwroot), mount it under a URL, and in milliseconds all your files are served with caching‚Äîno heavy framework required. Fast, lean, and ready for your Vue.js dashboard or static site...


## Why this library ?

I believe modern web application architecture should be based on a REST API which acts as a contract between 2 parts :
- backend (only one) : developer feels free to use/change the technology he wants (C#, Go, Rust, PHP...) but must provide and follow the REST API.
- frontend (one or many) : developer feels free to use/change the technology he wants (SPA/Vue, SPA/React, Mobile/Android...) but must consume and follow the REST API.


### My needs

**Frontend** :

- I prefer [SPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application) using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), [Vue](https://vuejs.org) and [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com).

**Backend** :

- written in C#, the language i üòç.
- must be easy to integrate, lightweight with a minimal footprint.
- must support Routing, Websocket, SSE, CORS.
- don't need to have template engine as i write frontend in a separated project.
- must serve static files (static files are the result of my `npm run build` vite project)
- observality : trace each request and monitor performances


### The existings projects
- [ASP.NET Core](https://learn.microsoft.com/fr-fr/aspnet/core/?view=aspnetcore-8.0) :
    - too many features i don't need, i don't want _(Razor, Blazor...)_.
    - overcomplicated to customize some behaviour
    - too heavy, sometimes i have a very small API.
- [IIS](https://iis.net/) an old _¬´ usine √† gaz ¬ª_ on Windows, Kestrel and SignalR the same on Linux.
- [EmbedIO](https://github.com/unosquare/embedio) : long time v2 user, i dislike the rewrite of the v3. Moreover, it uses the old Microsoft `HttpListener` and the `websocket-sharp` alternative was not perfect.
- [GenHttp](https://genhttp.org) : feels promising but i was in the process of writting my own.
- __[NetCoreServer](https://github.com/chronoxor/NetCoreServer)__ : WHOA üòÆ ! Fast, simple, extremly well design, extendable BUT no RESTAPI... Wait, what if i use the whole `OnReceivedRequest()` event to do exactly what i want ü§î


### This project

SimpleW is the result of adding features to the `OnReceivedRequest()` of [NetCoreServer](https://github.com/chronoxor/NetCoreServer).

After 3 years grade production, SimpleW serves many APIs without any issue, gains some cool features but still always lightweight and easy to integrate.

Feel free to report issue.
